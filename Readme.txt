---- Used libraries ----
How to run the code: You can access our site with the link 

https://evasquez25.github.io/CS171-Final-Project/

But, you can also use VSCode's live server to host the 
site locally and enjoy all the same features, given that
you have cloned our code repository. 


---- Used libraries ----
- d3 for Javascript
- Bootstrap for formatting HTML
- d3-cloud for implementing the word cloud
- Note that we also imported scrollama and a slider as we wanted to 
use them to implement scrollytelling and a slider feature for our
line graph. However, we did not end up implementing these features. 

Note: We also followed a tutorial to create a typing animation for
our title, linked below.
