                <p class="description">
                    Our world is reflected and influenced by the reporting of 
                    major media companies, which observe and spread news stories
                    about events in a digestible and meaningful way. The 
                    tecnological advancements of the last several decades have
                    also shown us that media is not only a game of reporting, but
                    also capturing readers' attention. Thus, headlines of news
                    articles seek to toe the line between delivering information
                    with journalistic integrity and also piquing peoples'
                    curiousity. We sought to answer
                    the following questions about New York Times Headlines
                    from the years 1990 to 2020.

                    1. What was important to readers
                    over the years 1990-2020. How is it different to what is
                    important to readers now?
                </p>
                <p class="description">

                In the meantime, we can discuss takeaways from this project.
                This project has taught us that media is an everchanging landscape.
                Even within the record keeping and data of these esteemed media companies like the New York Times,
                the data formatting is inconsistent and disorganized at times.
                So for the average reader, it definitely will be difficult to keep track of how headlines change over time.

            <h4>1991</h4>
            <p class="description">
                In 1991, the Soviet Union officially dissolved amidst
                great political instability and calls for reform in 
                its eastern satellite states. Mikhail Gorbachev, the 
                former president of the Soviet Union, attempted to
                improve government transparency and civil
                liberties like freedom of speech and press through his
                policies of Glasnost. He even attempted introducing
                market reforms to the Soviet economy through his
                policies of Perestroika.

                        What was the New York Times' coverage of these reforms?
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        In the  1991 opinion section article (author not 
                        found in our dataset), titled "Broken Glasnost", 
                        heavily criticized  the Glasnost policies as a failing 
                        to lead up to their 
                        ideological promises of openness, "Now, instead of 
                        openness, Orwellian propaganda spews forth". Similar 
                        sentiments are echoed in George Whitney's 1991 article 
                        "Moscow's Iron Hand: Gorbachev, Facing Growing Disorder, 
                        Chooses Control over Liberalization".

                        headlines contain the words "soviet", "russian", or

                        Amidst great political and economic instability
                        The Russian oil industry
                        suffered heavy hits. Russian involvement in the Gulf War
                        also stretched its resources thin. That same year,
                        the 1991 Racha 7.2 Magnitude Earthquake struck the region
                        of modern day Georgia, killing around 100 civilians. All
                        of these events contributed to the fall of the Soviet
                        Union, and the New York Times covered all these events
                        closely. The word 'Soviet' is included 566 times in our
                        database in the year 1991, one of the most commonly
                        occuring keywords that year.

                As many Americans are aware, throughout 2007 and 2008, the 
                United States and experienced a large scale financial crisis,
                paralleling the 1929 Wall Street crash that started the
                Great Depression. Interestingly enough, this period of time
                also marks a change in some of the coverage of the New York
                Times between different news desks.

                        As you may have already observed in the line graph above,
                        during this time, the number of articles published in the
                        business, economy, and finance news desk stayed high, before
                        dropping after the financial crisis was relieved in the following
                        years from 2010 to 2012. As for other news desks, this period
                        marked the peak in the coverage of the world, entertainment
                        and entertainment news desks. It marked stark dropoffs in the
                        sports, home, weekend and media news desks.

            <p class="description">
                When we search the top keywords in the headlines of most
                years, the name of the president at the time usually shows
                up. Like Clinton and Bush. 2016 marked a big change in this
                trend. In our analysis of the headlines, in the 2016 election,
                the names of multiple candidates and the president at the
                time all show up as top keywords in the headlines.
