                <p class="description">
                    Our world is reflected and influenced by the reporting of 
                    major media companies, which observe and spread news stories
                    about events in a digestible and meaningful way. The 
                    tecnological advancements of the last several decades have
                    also shown us that media is not only a game of reporting, but
                    also capturing readers' attention. Thus, headlines of news
                    articles seek to toe the line between delivering information
                    with journalistic integrity and also piquing peoples'
                    curiousity. We sought to answer the following questions or 
                    achieve the following goals with the New York Times Headlines
                    from the years 1991 to 2020.

                    1. What was important to readers
                    over the years 1991-2020. How is it different to what is
                    important to readers now?

                <p class="description">
                    2. How can we piece together historical events and
                    stories through the headlines of the New York Times?

                    data analysis component of our CS1090A class, a class 
                    on data science. Once we are done with that project, 
                    we will provide the link to those materials as well. We
                    worked on principle component analysis of our data and
                    also built predictive models for regression and classification.

                Observe the next two scatter plots below with different colored data points. 
                Principle Component Analysis allows us to see that semantically, there are
                differences between different headlines in the "business, economy, and 
                finance" and "travel" news desks. We also see that there are differences
                between the "Media" and "Sports" news desks. This is because the different
                colored data points tend to bunch up into clusters with other data points of
                the same color. A little more about this below...

                        Part of our project involved performing principle component analysis
                        (PCA) on the vector embeddings of the headlines. We were able to use 
                        a sentence transformer Python library that converts text into very
                        high dimensional vectors. Then, these vectors can be contained in
                        one data matrix, which means that we can perform principle component
                        analysis on it! We won't discuss to much of what PCA actually is
                        mathematically. If you are unfamiliar, just know that it can used to
                        group complicated data into clusters and look for patterns.

                    <p class="description" style="padding-top: 0px">
                        As we can see, the vector embeddings of headlines from different
                        news desks actually do form different clusters, which means that
                        there do exist semantic differences in the headlines of different
                        news desks that Python's sentence transformer library can detect.
                        Since the contents of the headlines are different, they will
                        receive different values in their components of the vectors, and
                        PCA does the best job of visualizing these complicated differences.

                Next, we combed through keywords in the headlines that jumped out at us
                throughout the years. It was very cool and surprising in some cases to see
                what historical events can and cannot be observed from looking at an
                overview of the headlines. 
                This project has taught us that media is an everchanging landscape.
                Even within the record keeping and data of these esteemed media companies like the New York Times,
                the data formatting is inconsistent and disorganized at times.
                So for the average reader, it definitely will be difficult to keep track of how 
                headlines change over time.

                        PCA still works when we include many different news desks categories. 
                        If anything, it is even more interesting now. Interpretting the
                        different clusters that form above, we see that all the business,
                        economy, and finance related headlines tend to be projected into the
                        bottom area of the scatter plot, signifying that these points are
                        kind of in a region of their own in the high dimensional vector space.

                    Then we see that the world, international, and foreign news desk seems
                    to form a cluster on the left, while the weekend news forms a cluster
                    on the right. Finally, the home news desk forms a cluster in between the
                    "world, international, and foreign" and "weekend" clusters. Does this
                    PCA visualization make sense intuitively?

            <p class="description">
                In 1991, the Soviet Union officially dissolved amidst
                great political instability and calls for reform in 
                its eastern satellite states. Mikhail Gorbachev, the 
                former president of the Soviet Union, attempted to
                improve government transparency and civil
                liberties like freedom of speech and press through his
                policies of Glasnost. He even attempted introducing
                market reforms to the Soviet economy through his
                policies of Perestroika.

                        In the  1991 opinion section article (author not 
                        found in our dataset), titled "Broken Glasnost", 
                        heavily criticized  the Glasnost policies as a failing 
                        to lead up to their 
                        ideological promises of openness, "Now, instead of 
                        openness, Orwellian propaganda spews forth". Similar 
                        sentiments are echoed in George Whitney's 1991 article 
                        "Moscow's Iron Hand: Gorbachev, Facing Growing Disorder, 
                        Chooses Control over Liberalization".

                        During this time, we start seeing articles covering the financial
                        crisis itself with headlines like "Following the Financial Crisis 
                        and the Markets" and

                        Many other articles cover the effect of the crisis on certain other

            <p class="description">
                When we search the top keywords in the headlines of most
                years, the name of the president at the time usually shows
                up. Like Clinton and Bush. 2016 marked a big change in this
                trend. In our analysis of the headlines, in the 2016 election,
                the names of multiple candidates and the president at the
                time all show up as top keywords in the headlines.

                Our dataset came from Kaggle. We used the 
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnbandy/new-york-times-headlines">
                    Three Decades of New York Times Headlines
                </a> dataset as well as the
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tumanovalexander/nyt-articles-data">
                    New York Times Articles 1920-2020
                </a> dataset, both publically availible for use from Kaggle. Some of the 
                news desk descriptions came from the New York Times' own website. All of the photos
                are either from a New York Times article or a image of the New York Times 
                newspaper archives, available to us online.
